OVERVIEW:
	
  This package is 100% pure Java(tm) designed for use with a 1.3 or better JRE.
  It has been released under the GPL license; see GPL.TXT for details.
			  
  The package implements a Swing component that enables the creation of many types
  of diagram, flowcharts or similar tools. Its designed to be very fast and flexible.
  The diagram component itself is similar to the JTable in that both components are
  designed to allow new renderer and editor components to be written to customize its
  behavoir and appearance easily. The diagram component should be a useful addition
  to many applications.

EXAMPLES:

  A small UML design tool, named QuickUML has been created the illustrates one possible 
  use of this diagram package.

BUILDING:

  A Makefile intended for GNU Make is included. It includes options for builing jars
  for just the diagram package (Diagram-x.y.z.jar) or for the QuickUML tool 
  (QuickUML-x.y.z.jar). 'make help' will display a breif summary of the options.
  This Makefile is compatible with the Win32 port of GNU make, see the note in the
  notes section below.

USING:

  Running the QuickUML example is very easy. After compiling the source you will find
  the jar files in the lib directory. Using the -jar command you can launch the UML tool.

  'java -jar lib/QuickUML-.x.y.z.jar' 

  Or you can just click on the jar if you've got the proper associations setup in your 
  desktop environment. 

  The QuickUML jar is standalone and includes all the sources that diagram jar contains
  to make the easier to use and move around for demonstrations.

DISTRIBUTING:

  To use the diagram component in your own project you should distribute the 
  diagram-x.y.z.jar file with your code. You can a line similar to:

  Class-Path: Diagram-x.y.z.jar

  to any Manifest files that are used so the user doesn't need to worry about the 
  classpath.

DOCUMENTATION:
    
  The source is documentented and documentation can be generated easily using doxygen
  (or javadoc, but doxygen is a bit more comprehensive)

NOTES:

  If you find this software useful or have suggestions for improving it please contact
  me and let me know.

  The Makefile included allows the project to be compiled with GNU make pretty easily.
  If you're using a Windows OS, you can download a port of the GNU Make for Win32 from
